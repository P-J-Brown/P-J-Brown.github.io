									<h2>Irrigation and Agriculture in Southern Iraq</h2>
								</header>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>Across the floodplain of the Shatt al-Arab river in southern Iraq, over 7000 linear ridges, formed of piled up earth, lie across a largely abandoned landscape covering an area of around 800km2. These ridges are massive - many are more than 1 km in length - and the remains of old canals are found in amongst them. These features relate to the irrigation of a large area for arable farming at some point in the past. Until now, however, exactly when this agricultural system was cultivated and why it was abandoned have gone unconfirmed.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>Historical texts record a slave rebellion in the region in the late 9th century CE. Scholars have often suggested the ridges visible in the landscape today were created by these slaves and that the hard work required to erect the ridges and farm this landscape may even have been what provoked the rebellion. In the same period, the neighbouring city of Basra seems to have reached a peak in terms of population and commercial activity. Farming a large area would have been necessary both to feed the large urban population as well as to produce agricultural products for export to other cities and overseas.</p>
